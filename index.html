	<h1>Careers in Web and Design</h1>
	<h3>by Tommy Jasinski Jan 14th, 2020</h3>
	<p>The growth of the web over the last couple of decades has brought with it some new job titles. For example, had anyone ever heard of a webmaster prior to the mid-1990s? It has also redefined some older titles like advertising sales rep. Advertising sales reps used to sell ad space or time only in magazines and newspapers and on radio and television. Over the last two decades, they've added Websites to their repertoire.</p>
	<p>Can you think of any company that does not have a web presence? The Web and Digital Design Pathway here at Paulding County High School will equip students with the ability to plan, design, and create  websites. Students will not only learn how to  write code, they will also learn various forms of multimedia elements.  These elements include text, graphics, animation, sound, video and digital imaging, photography, in addition to computer programming, visual development, project development and web processes.  Skills learned will help students create and design websites that incorporate digital media elements used to enhance content of a website. Students in this pathway will learn to work individually and in teams to create web professional looking web sites.  Professional communication skills and practices, problem-solving, ethical and legal issues, and the impact of effective presentation skills will be enhanced in this pathway to prepare students to be college and career ready.</p>

	<p>Web developers need a combination of graphic design skills and technical computer skills that will allow them to create particular designs on web pages. In addition to looking nice, websites need to be functional and secure. It is the responsibility of web developers to create such sites that meet the requirements of employers or clients. Web developers often are implementing ideas that others may have even those others lack the technical know-how to turn those ideas into an actual, functional website. Web developers build and shape visitors’ experiences at websites. They do this through the creation of page layouts (headings and paragraphs), website styling (colors and fonts), and page features (animations and pictures). Interactive features, such as submitting online payments securely, are a necessary feature of e-commerce sites. In some settings, web developers can get started with no more than a high school diploma, but an associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree typically is needed to advance in the field. This job generally requires the ability to do the following work:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Graphic design</li>
	<li>Know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and other relevant web design coding languages</li>
	<li>Collaborate</li>

	<p>Look around you. Graphic design is everywhere, from the wrappers on candy bars to the logo on your favorite coffee mug. In fact, you see hundreds of examples of graphic design every single day, and most of the time, you don't realize it.  Graphic Designers are often responsible for the way websites look and are often referred to as web designers. They use visual elements to communicate messages through this medium as well as through others. Many employers prefer to hire graphic designers who have earned a bachelor's degree in graphic design.  Graphic design can serve many functions. Just a few of the uses of graphic design include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Signage</li>
	<li>Corporate identity and branding</li>
	<li>Packaging (from water bottles to appliances)</li>

	<p>A cinematographer is also known as a director of photography (DP), is the person in charge of the camera department which includes all camera operators, camera assistants, focus pullers, and lighting crews. The DP is responsible for capturing the photographic impression of the directors’ vision. While the director determines the action and blocking of a given scene, it is the DP who looks through the camera to catch the moment on film. The director gives his/her vision of a particular shot to the DP, who then translates that into how the camera will capture it.The DP receives a shot list from the director and then analyzes how each scene will be lit, which camera filters and lenses to use, and the position of the camera. To be a truly memorable cinematographer, there are a few skills you will want to master:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Your eye:Before the camera captures a shot, you need to fully envision it in your own mind. This is a skill that needs to be developed very early.</li>
	<li>Lighting: Study lighting. In everyday life, look around and see how light works to set a mood. You have to understand how to work with lighting to get the most out of your shots.</li>
	<li>Study the past: Study movies and find out what it is about certain shots that work and learn how it was accomplished.</li>
	<li>Technology: Stay up on the latest photographic technology.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Today's teens —13- to 17-year-olds (Gen Z) — make up 27% of all gamers. One generation ahead of them are millennials (18 to 34-year-olds) who represent 29% of all gamers. If you are a member of either of these generations, you may have thought, or even dreamt of, a career in the video game industry. Fortunately, there are many options from which to choose, both on the technical and business sides of this industry, that will take advantage of your passion for gaming.</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Game Designers - At the top of the list of dream jobs for gamers is video game designer. Those who work in this occupation come up with the concepts that eventually become video games. They see those ideas through to fruition by developing storylines and characters and then guiding them through production. They collaborate with other members of the development team including artists, programmers, and audio engineers. </li>
	<li>Software Developers and Computer Programmers - Software developers and computer programmers implement game designers' visions for their final products. Developers design software that makes video games work the way the designers want them to. Programmers create the code that converts those designs into instructions video game systems can read.</li>
	<li>Animators - As an integral part of the video game development team, animators make video games come to life visually. Using specialized software, animators create a series of pictures that form the images in a video game, including the characters and the environment.</li>
	<li>Video Game Testers - Game testers provide quality assurance (QA) for the companies that produce video games. They make sure games function correctly, and that instructions and documentation are clear. They identify problems and bugs and report their findings to designers and developers.</li>
		<li>Market Research Analysts - Market research analysts design surveys that they will use to determine prospective customers' buying preferences. They use the data they gather to help video game publishers decide what products and services to sell, how much to charge for them, and where and how to sell them.</li>
		<li>Sales Representatives - Sales representatives sell video games to wholesalers or retailers on behalf of publishers. They need extensive knowledge about the products, the video game industry, and potential customers.</li>
	</ul>
